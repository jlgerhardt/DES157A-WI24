        <p>
          While creating digital comps for the updated version of the game I stumbled upon many different road blocks that both gave me ideas and restricted ideas I previously had. For example, while a betting system would be interesting, there is no incentive for the player to earn more money. This problem could be solved with an idea I had mentioned previously: customization. The player could win more in order to buy different dice, or perhaps a different table.
        </p>

        <p>
          this ideation presents a few problems. Does the player start with money? I've considered giving each player at least a certain amount that they can never go under. However, the everytime to page resets with 'location reload' in order to start the game over again, the money would not save. I'd have to find another way to reset the game. Betting should occur before each game starts, players can choose from a set amount of values.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd also like visual elements to appear that correspond with the players wealth. On the example comp, each player has a few chips next to their playing zone. The chips would change depending on the score.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I'd like to include sort of easter-eggs if I have time. Maybe rare varieties of dice that can only be unlocked by clicking on certain areas of the page.
