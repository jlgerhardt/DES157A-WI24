            Final Project Brief
        </h3>

        <h4>Summary</h4>

        <p>
          I would like to push the game-on project further with the final project because I had imagined several different aspects of the game that could improve the experience but I did not have time to implement them.
        </p>

        <h4>Description</h4>

        <p>
          There are few aspects of the game I'd like to push further, those include: a betting feature, randomly varying sounds, responsiveness on larger devices, interactive background links, gameplay animations, and a win counter to name a few. I believe these aspects would push the idea further in all required aspects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe it would be possible to improve the button designs using JavaScript instead of strictly HTML and CSS. The buttons I can create in CSS are rather limiting for the aesthetic I have chosen. I'd like the game to be as hi-fi appearing as possible with attention to detail such as this. Small details I have glossed over visually in code as well like a accurate favicon could improve the overall quality as well. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I have had an interest in customization/personalization in games for a very long time, I love when the developers take into account the user experience in this way. Perhaps being able to choose the color of the dice for each player would give the players customization to further connect with the game. Maybe even an option to change the poker table color would be interesting. Each table would have different textures, objects, and splatters, additions to the very simple game that could make it more appealing. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Other considerations for the game would be minor gameplay changes to fix replayability. Recoding the 'play again' button to restart the game instead of reloading the page would allow the background noise to loop seamlessly. Additionally, the dice will give the incorrect appearance for the actual data, which is a problem I will probably have to reach out for help for; I do not understand why a bug like that exists.
        </p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>

        <p>
          Much of the feedback I had received included mentioning of some sort of betting feature to make playing the game over and over more realistic. At the moment there are no incentives to play more than one time. Responsiveness was also a large point of mention for reviewers, Creating a larger bnackground image that can be cropped to the correct viewport size is a high priority when returning to the project. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Lost of positive feedback for possible customization! People want to be able to change the environment to their liking. I believe I will start with an option to choose the color of your dice first, but customization is definitely a high priority.
