                Game Design Research
            </h3>

            <p>
                Abrar (the TA) reviewed my code. I proposed to him my idea of creating a betting/currency system in JS to accompany the base game. We reviewed a few digital comps of my idea, most of which are additions to the base game, so none of the visual elements had to be changed. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As well as creating a new variable for each player to hold their scores, some of the base game code must be altered to make sure the score remains the same after each game. Most importantly, the restarting/quitting the game can no longer use location.reload. A simple function to restart the players game score and return the game to the starting point should work fine.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also shortly discussed the possibilty of creating some sort of shop for the players to spend the currency for things like different colored dice, but ultimately decided to tackle the betting feature first.
