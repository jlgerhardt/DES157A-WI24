                Form Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                Scenarios where data collection is required digitally is an incredibly common occurence. Job applications, account creation, and performace reviews are necessary occurences through workplaces and casual environments. Proper form design to improve the users experience is vital for actual completion of the form. No one in their right mind loves to fill out a digital form, so at the very least, the designer should cater to the user as much as possible to create a seamless expereience. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Proper posing of labels, minimal information requirements, and consideration of accessbility greatly increases the likelihood that the user will complete the form with transparency and details. When creating forms, the designer must be deliberate with all of the objects on the page; micro-interactions from form to form seperate thoughtful design from meaningless code.

                <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account creation uses interactive elements and minimal information presentation to guide the user through the form quickly. The transitions from form to form are satisfying and simple, encouraging the user to continue.
