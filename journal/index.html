                Game Design Research
            </h3>

            <p>
                User experience is a beautiful combination of design and psychology. Game design particularly considers so many different micro-interactions that I would have never thought were so important. Placement of the buttons, hierarchy of content, and user-friendly areas are all topics im familiar with but have not considered just how present they are in most applications that I use. The more I study UX design, the more I realise that research and understanding how the audience will interact with your product is what I should be designing for (prior to this realization I had been creating work for myself). 
            </p>

            <p>
                 Digital marketing seeks to take advantage of patterns we find comfortable and lead the consumer to make decisions that would be beneficial for the producer. For whatever reason, I had never considered myself to be so interested in what is essentially digital marketing. I haven't personally decided how I feel about this fact, but the truth of the matter is that UI/UX is greatly based around attempting to 'sell' the audience on something. I had considered myself to be much more interested in the 'fine art' aspect of design, but human interactions with the product are incredibly interesting.

                Visual Thinking Analysis
            </h3>

            <h4>Part 1</h4>

            <p>
                This is my first real addition to my collection of playing cards. They are the only set of borderless playing cards I own and are part of the <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/search?query=metalluxe&filter=null" target="_blank">"Bicyle Metalluxe"</a> collection. They feel, look, and play the best out of all the cards I own. For those reasons and the fact that red is my favorite color, they are easily my favorite deck of cards. For most of the cards, the most play they will see is through meaningless shuffling at my desk to keep my hands busy, or the occasional solitaire game. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The image itself is a documentation of the deck cards with a view of the back and front side. The ace of spades, a red face card, and a joker are displayed in order to detail the aesthetic of the cards with the least amount of content. The box is also an important part of the display as it contains unique designs matching the theme. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My collection says two things about me. Firstly, I generally appreciate consistent design formats with different renditions and themes. In this scenario the medium is playing cards, each deck of cards is the same size, contains the same amount of cards, and functionally has two faces. This level of organization is a perfect transition into the second reason I find playing cards so attractive. To help myself sleep at night, I often watch videos of people playing solitaire with varying decks of playing cards. I believe the toiling of cards and repeated actions helps me relax. This sort of repeated, expected action creates a very comfortable environment. I thrive in stability. 
            </p>

            <h4>Part 2</h4>

            <p>
                My partners image showcases a small collection of figurines. The figures are from varying shows, games, and places. I think it is worth mentioning how much effort was put into the showcase. A custom background, photoshopped elements, and color palette are all expressions of the creator. These details are apart of a bigger picture for the artist and demonstrate care for order and vanity (relatively common traits found in passionate design students, and by all means a compliment).
            </p>

            <p>
                I personally find the background of the image to be the most interesting part. I believe its a photo of their bedroom witha gradient placed over top. A generally simple concept but executed exceptionally well. They had expressed care for decorating their living space and it is evident through the photo. It leaves me asking questions such as; what do the other walls look like? What other sort of decorations are around the room? What are the stories behind each of the posters?
            </p>

            <p>
                The most obvious aspect is that this person likes color! There is no lack of it in the image. Mysterious aspects include, where did each of the figurines come from? What do each of them mean to the owner? Is there a favorite figurine out of the four?

                Visual Thinking Strategies
            </h3>

            <p>
                The best visual representations make the audience ask questions. Much like large portions of text, the overall subject becomes much more interesting if there is a narrative involved. The most interesting photos in that article cause the reader to consider more than just the physical properties of what can be found inside the image. Questions such as 'why?' or 'how?' are pivotal in capturing the audiences attention. I think it is also fair to mention that most of the photos in that article are from a foreign environment in comparison to demopgrahic of The New York Times audience. Images that challenge your perspective and force you to 'leave your bubble' are innately more interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
                The audience will become more invested if they do not have all the answers. Perhaps it is derivative of the natural curiosity found in most humans, but the pattern is undeniable nonetheless.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my research, I found a website that takes advantage of a the perspective-pushing properties that works so well to please the curious mind. <a href="https://onnujonuson.com/clip" target="_blank">Onnu Jonu Son</a> is a musical artist participating in the Icelandic folf music scene. His website displays a foreign world, and leaves the audience asking questions.

            <h3>
                Modal Design Patterns
            </h3>

            <p>
                The use of modals for as long I can remember, have been utterly frowned upon. It is instinct for most users to immediately find the cancel button to close the window, especially if the window appears unprompted. There are few worse ways to interrupt a users experience on a website than forcing an overlay onto their screen that must be interacted with in order to continue what they were doing.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I personally believe that modals should be avoided at all cost, there will inevitably be scenarios in which one is necessary to prevent additional space from being taken up on the main page. When this is the case, there are key factors into making the model less nauseating.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most important factors to consider when creating an effective modal are the size, intiation, and escape. First, the size of the modal must not take up more than 50% of the page; this is to prevent confusion from the user that they may have left the page. Second, the modal must be user intiaited. Do not force modals onto the user. Lastly, provide the user with a clear escape route. Do not trap the user in the modal. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Even with the use of all of these techniques to avoid interruption, I highly discourage the use of modals. 
            </p>

                Form Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                Scenarios where data collection is required digitally is an incredibly common occurence. Job applications, account creation, and performace reviews are necessary occurences through workplaces and casual environments. Proper form design to improve the users experience is vital for actual completion of the form. No one in their right mind loves to fill out a digital form, so at the very least, the designer should cater to the user as much as possible to create a seamless expereience. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Proper posing of labels, minimal information requirements, and consideration of accessbility greatly increases the likelihood that the user will complete the form with transparency and details. When creating forms, the designer must be deliberate with all of the objects on the page; micro-interactions from form to form seperate thoughtful design from meaningless code. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> account creation uses interactive elements and minimal information presentation to guide the user through the form quickly. The transitions from form to form are satisfying and simple, encouraging the user to continue.
